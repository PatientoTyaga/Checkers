# Checkers
Checkers is a classic board game that is played on an 8x8 grid. This repository contains a Python implementation of the game with a simple command-line interface. It allows two players to play against each other in a game of checkers, following the standard rules of the game. I am currently learning how to use pygame and sharpenning my skills with python and building a checkers game is good practice
